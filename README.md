## Boulder & Denver
Boulder and Denver are two distinct cities that are very near to each other, and they are both tech hubs. Denver is extremely large compared to Boulder, and Boulder is a lot more residential with Denver having more of a commercial and industrial complex built around it as well as residential. Most Boulder tech offices are centered around the Boulder downtown area, the mainstay of which is Pearl Street. Larger tech companies will rent more office space on the east side of town where there are less residential neighborhoods and more commerical real estate. Denver tech is centered Downtown or in the DTC (Denver Tech Center).

The two cities are only about about [30 minutes away](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Denver,+CO/Boulder,+CO/@39.8770264,-105.2662174,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x876b80aa231f17cf:0x118ef4f8278a36d6!2m2!1d-104.990251!2d39.7392358!1m5!1m1!1s0x876b8d4e278dafd3:0xc8393b7ca01b8058!2m2!1d-105.2705456!2d40.0149856!3e0) from each other, but that can turn into almost an hour during rush hour. Typically, commuting out of Denver into Boulder everyday is the worse of the two options, whereas commuting out of Boulder into Denver is relatively smooth sailing. Boulder is extremely expensive to live in, so traffic into Boulder for the work day and out at the end of the day is pretty extreme as a lot of Boulder's workforce lives outside the city.

Denver is home to the Auraria campus, which houses University of Colorado at Denver, Metropolitan State University and Community College of Denver on a single, shared campus. Boulder is home to the University of Colorado at Boulder, and has a very "college town" feel to it in areas surrounding the university.

Night life in both cities is extremely active, with action centering around Pearl Street in Boulder and 16th Street and Market Street in Denver.

## Neighborhoods

### Denver Tech Center
### Rino
Rino or "River North" encompasses the area just north of downtown on either side of the train tracks and bordered  by the Platte river on the west. Primarily old warehouses and manufacturing plants, this area is currently seeing rapid redevelopment. With the opening of the Colorado A line the DIA and the 38th & Blake st. station, this area is experiencing tremendous growth and will be unrecognizable in a few years due to rezoning of up to 16 stories.

Right now this area is home to great restaurants and breweries, but very little residential especially on the Brighton blvd side of the tracks. The eastern half of Rino is home to the Larimer St shopping district. This area is home to The Big Wonderful seasonal, endless breweries and new restaurants [(like Biju's Little Curry shop )](https://www.littlecurryshop.com/), and some beautiful modern residences.

### Five Points
Five points consists of some smaller neighborhoods namely; Curtis Park, Whittier, Cole, Five Points, and the San Rafael historic district. These neighborhoods are home to some of the oldest houses and communities in Denver. Restaurants like Tom's Home Cookin' and buildings like the Rossonian Hotel are reminders of the rich history this area has to offer.

### Colfax
Colfax is a strange neighborhood; it's a block wide, multiple miles long avenue that cuts through the middle of Denver. It infamously has a reputation as the "the longest and most wicked street in America." It's home to all sorts of wonders weirdness including Voodoo Donuts, the Tattered Cover, the Fillmore Auditorium, the Cathedral Basilica, Bluebird Theater, Ogden Theatre, and a ton of dive bars, breweries, and restaurants. You're more likely to run into "characters" in this neighborhood than almost anywhere else in Denver.

### Baker
### Capitol Hill
### Wash Park
### LoHi
### West Highlands/Berkeley
This is a pair of neighborhoods in NW Denver that are very similar. The major access route is Speer, going west of 25/Platte River. West Highlands is bounded by 29th Ave to the South, Sheridan to the West, 38th Ave to the North, and Federal to the East. Berkeley is the neighborhood immediately north of W Highlands.
These neighborhoods are more residential than many of the downtown neighborhoods, with lower density housing. Speer offers quick and easy access to the freeway and downtown, and Sheridan/Federal are direct routes to the suburbs of Westminster/Broomfield (which also have many tech employers). They are just south of 70, which goes to the mountains and the airport.
These neighborhoods tend to attract families in their late 20's through early 40's who want to be close to the city without being right in the middle of it.
32nd Ave a block west of Federal, and Tennyson St between 38th and 46th Aves, are shopping districts. Tennyson runs a First Friday art-walk during the summer. There are many parks and a regional rec center in these neighborhoods.
